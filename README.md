This repository is for Comp 20 - Web Programming with Ming Chow

My favorite project in this class was transit because overall it seemed like the most useful and real world application that we created.

The transit project is also the one that I am the most proud of because it took the most work to get running.

My computer science abilities have improved greatly in this class. I learned how to create web pages using a variety of different tools including html, css, javascript, node.js, and mongodb.
