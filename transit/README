Assignment 3 Transit

The webpage successfully renders the google map and is centered on the users
current position using the navigator.geolocation. A marker displays the users
location, and clicking on this marker displays the current lat/lng. 
XMLhttprequest is used to get information from the mbta rodeo server. The line
recieved is rendered on the map with markers at each station and a polyline 
connects the stations. Clicking on the station marker gives the line, destination
and arrival time of the trains. The page displays the closest subway station to
the user's current position (in miles).

I collaborated with Nate Winters and Matt Long.

This assignment took me approximately 20 hours to complete.
